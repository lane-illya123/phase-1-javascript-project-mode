Description: For my phase-1 project i decided on a single-page HTML anime database. First, i fetch data from the Jikan API. First, i used a forEach to iterate the data from the API but I changed it to a map so i could extract the names and elements from the data. That allowed me to make my search bar so i could sort thur the title names. After that, I used the data to make four event handlers for my website. Each event handler had to loop through the data so all my card divs would have the event handler assigned to them 

Features: My website includes a search bar that filters the show by their name. A click function that will take you to the image's original page. A mouse on and mouse off event listener that will change the color of the titles when hovered over.
